**************************************************************

This simple python program will generate a random word and random point value associated with that word to assist in playing a game of charades.

The program will ask for the number of players. It will then loop the number of times inputed (number of players), each time displaying 10 random words with a random point value between 1 and 10 for each word. The program will wait 2 minutes after displaying a set of 10 words and point values before automatically displaying the next set.
