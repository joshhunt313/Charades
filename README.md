This simple python program will generate 10 random words and point values associated with each word to assist in playing a game of charades.

Each players turn it displays 10 random words with a random point value between 1 and 10 for each word. The program will wait 2 minutes after displaying a set of 10 words and point values before automatically displaying the next set.

The random words and numbers are pulled using respective apis.
